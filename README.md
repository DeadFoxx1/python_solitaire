# about:
I started this project as soon as I learned about what a python class is.
THIS MEANS ITS TRASH!!!
Honestly don't know what I was doing with this lol


## setup:
Must have python and pygame
```sh
git clone https://github.com/DeadFoxx1/Python_Solitaire
cd Python_Solitaire
python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate  # on macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt # right now it's just pygame 
```
